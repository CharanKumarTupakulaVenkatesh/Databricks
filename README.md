# Databricks
## Databricks Architecture and Workspace UI
The Databricks Lakehouse platform is a cloud-native implementation of the lakehouse model. Another way of saying this is that it's a data storage layer that resides on top of the data lake. This offers several advantages, including the performance and reliability of a data warehouse, combined with the flexibility, cost, efficiency and scale of data lake. 

All together, this makes for a powerful platform.

Another advantage of this architecture is that it allows a variety of data practitioners––including data analysts, data engineers, and machine learning engineers––to perform their roles in a unified, scalable way.
